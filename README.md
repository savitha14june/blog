# blog
Personal blog website - created to demonstrate hands-on experience with ReactJS and Bootstrap. The project serves as a practical application of core React concepts, component-based architecture, and responsive web design principles.

# Technologies Used
ReactJS: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces. This project focuses on using functional components and hooks to manage state and lifecycle.
Bootstrap: A powerful, open-source front-end toolkit for building responsive layouts and styling with pre-built components.
React Router: A standard library for routing in React applications, used here for navigating the different pages of the blog.

# About the Project
This project was built primarily as a learning exercise. It was designed to solidify my understanding of the following key concepts:
React Fundamentals: Components, props, state, and event handling.
React Hooks: Using useState and useEffect for managing component state and side effects.
Styling with a Framework: Integrating and customizing Bootstrap for a professional and consistent look.
The experience gained from this project will be a stepping stone for more complex and feature-rich applications in the future.
